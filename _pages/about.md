Welcome! I am a neurocritical care physician-scientist who aims to improve the outcomes of individuals with acute and severe brain injury such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke and status epilepticus.

## Background

I obtained my undergraduate degree in chemistry at McGill University and my medical degree at Université de Montréal. During my postgraduate medical education at Université de Montréal, I completed training in the neurology, critical care medicine and clinician-investigator programs, and I obtained my master's degree in epidemiology and certification in electroencephalography. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Disorders of Consciousness Lab in the Department of Neurology at Columbia University.  

## Interests

My research currently focuses on these themes:
- Infratentorial stroke and the isolated brainstem death construct among patients suspected of death by neurologic criteria;
- Impact of sedative and analgesic medications on consciousness assessment in critically ill individuals;
- Prediction of functional recovery from acute disorders of consciousness.

I also have interests in ICU electroencephalography, management of status epilepticus, and end-of-life care in the ICU.
